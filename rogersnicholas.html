<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>Baltimore's unique 
  public market system dates back to 1763 when the first market was erected at 
  Gay and Baltimore Streets with funds raised through a lottery. Eleven markets 
  eventually encircled the heart of the city, each serving a distinct neighborhood 
  and clientele. Belair Market is located at 4760 North Gay street next to Old 
  Town Mall. <br>
  <br>
  The sixth Baltimore market, Belair Market, was constructed on land deeded to 
  the City for five dollars in 1818 by Nicholas Rogers, owner of the estate that 
  became Druid Hill Park. <br>
  <br>
  The market derives its name from the Belle-Air Road, one of the early turnpikes 
  that fanned out like the spokes of a wheel connecting the city to the surrounding 
  counties. On the nights preceding markets days, farmers rumbled down the road 
  in conestoga wagons laden with hay, produce, and livestock for city consumers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The farmers would often put up for the night at a nearby hotel, a lively spot 
  where so much trading was carried on that the hotel itself became something 
  of a market place. <br>
  <br>
  In 1871 a windstorm lifted the roof of the market. several markets have succeeded 
  the original structure. At one time, the market was made up of more than six 
  buildings, but a fire in the 1930s drastically reduced its size. The Belair 
  Market became part of the successful urban renewal efforts of Oldtown beginning 
  in 1969. <br>

  <p>Captain, Co. F, 72nd Pennsylvania (Baxter's Fire Zouaves). Wounded at battle 
    of Antietam, Sept. 17, 1862 (&quot;Shot through Knee&quot;).</p>
  <p>&quot;Captain Isaac McBride of the Seventy Second (72nd) Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, having applied for a certificate on which to ground an application for leave of absence, I do hereby certify that I have carefully examined this officer and find that he is now suffering under the effects of a gun-shot wound of the knee-joint producing paralysis of the lower extremity which has disabled him during a period of four weeks. And that in consequence thereof, he is, in my opinion, unfit for duty. I further declare my belief taht he will not be able to resume his duties in a less period than thirty days. Philadelphia, Octbr 17th 1862. H D McLean MD, Attending Physician.&quot; NARA RG 94 Box 35035.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>The 72nd Pennsylvania 
    at Antietam (Sharpsburg, Maryland) suffered a casualty rate of 34.8%. The regiment was part of Sedgwick's Division that formed the left 
    flank of II Corps as they advanced from Pry Ford, westward through the East 
    Woods, across Smoketown Road, and into the West Woods. The division was flanked in the West Woods and in 20 minutes suffered 2300 casualties. The exact location of the unit is approximately 75 yards due North of the Dunker Church and just to the west of the Hagerstown 
    Pike about 50 yards. The unit was decimated and reassembled in the East Woods and then relocated to the North Woods where they were held in reserve. They did  did not return to action. See above references to 72nd Pennsylvania.</p>
  <p>Bill Paton, Isaac McBride's great grandson, wrote in April 2010 about A &quot;Manual of Instructions for the Volunteers and Militia of the United States&quot; by Major William Gilham, Instructor of Tactics and Commandant of Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute. Published in 1861in Philadelphia.&quot; <br>
  </p>
  <p>&quot;On the back of an envelope slipped in the front it mentions &quot;National Tribune June 28, 1894&quot; and notes that the book was found on the battlefield of Gettysburg on July 4 1863 by William G. Black of Barlow Penna and &quot;returned through the mail July 7th 1894 - an interval of 31 years&quot;. </p>
  <p>Isaac may have given his manual to his brother after being wounded at Antietam who then carried it to Gettysburg where it was lost.</p>

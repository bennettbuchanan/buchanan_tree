A Signal Service by Bits and Bytes   http://pages.cthome.net/fwc/MYER.HTM</b>

     Authorized in a rather qualified way in the hectic August of
1861, Myer's first Signal Train was finally ready by the first of
the new year.  It was constructed by one Henry J. Rogers, a
telegraph engineer, under Myer's supervision.  The telegraph
instrument was a "letter indicator" device, designed to be employed 
by ordinary personnel. Upon the pointer being rotated to a certain
letter on the dial, the pointer on a distant machine would revolve 
to the designated character accordingly.  Battery powered, the units 
also had conventional keys and sounders, for operators skilled in 
Morse telegraphy.  The mobile train was also furnished with light-
weight temporary poles and reels of insulated wire, two innovations 
which were to survive the system's and Myer's subsequent downfall.
     The system arrived at the Georgetown Signal Camp in January,
1862 and was examined by a board consisting of officers Cushing,
Fisher and Wonderly.  They generally approved of the train, but
technical problems prevented its being ready to take the field in
March, for McClellan's use in the impending Peninsula Campaign.</pre>

<p>In 1817, Captain Frederick Marryat of the Royal Navy published his <i>Code of Signals for the Merchant Service</i>.&nbsp; Based on the 1799 naval code, it was also a numeric system, but with a vocabulary oriented more toward commercial and less toward naval needs.&nbsp; Marryat's code was widely accepted, and by 1854 was known as the "Universal Code of Signals."&nbsp; In the United States, a number of codes were developed for the merchant marine, including James M. Elford's <i>Universal Signal Book (1818), </i>Richard Berrian's <i>American Telegraphic and Signal Book</i> (1823), and J. R. Parker's <i>American Signal Book</i> (1832).&nbsp; Parker's system was updated and improved in a number of successive editions and was eventually succeeded in 1847 by Henry J. Rogers' <i>Rogers and Black's American Semaphoric Signal Book for the Use of Vessels Employed in the United States Naval, Revenue and Merchant Service.&nbsp; </i>As the title suggests, this volume was the first commercial signaling system adopted for use by the government for non-tactical communications.&nbsp; Rogers continued to publish revised editions of this work under various titles until 1856.&nbsp; A year later, a breakthrough in the science of marine communications made Rogers' system obsolete. </p>
<p>That breakthrough was midwifed by the British Board of Trade, the government agency responsible for the merchant marine.&nbsp; In 1855, the Board had appointed a committee to develop an improved code, which was promulgated in 1857 as the <i>Commercial Code of Signals.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board of Trade's code had not only the previous numeric flags but flags specifically for letters as well, although for only 18 of them.&nbsp; The breathtaking increase in flexibility and order of magnitude leap in the number of signals that could be constructed made the new system a rapid success:&nbsp; 18 letters and 10 numerals could be hoisted in over 20,000 three-flag combinations, compared to only 1,000 using numbers alone.&nbsp; Over the years, the Commercial Code was expanded, revised, and updated.&nbsp; In 1870, it was renamed the <i><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Emcmillanj/signals/Signals.html#intlltr">International Code of Signals</a></i>&nbsp; and before the turn of the century all the major maritime powers were publishing their own editions of the code.&nbsp; In 1965, management of the ICS was taken over by the United Nations' International Maritime Organization.&nbsp; Each major seafaring country still publishes the ICS for the use of its mariners. </p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>Henry J. Rogers</h3>

<p><b>ROGERS, Henry J., inventor, born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1811 ; died
there, 20 August, 1879. He devised the code of signals by means of flags that
is known by his name, which was adopted by the United States navy in 1846 and
modified in 1861. Mr. Rogers also devised a code of signals by means of colored
lights, which was the first pyrotechnic system in the United States. He was one
of the practical advisers of Samuel F. B. Morse in the construction of the
first electro-magnetic recording telegraph-line in tile United States which was
established in 1844 between Washington and Baltimore. When the experiment had
reached a successful issue he was appointed superintendent of the line, with
his office in Baltimore, and there made numerous improvements in the system.
Subsequently he invented several important telegraphic instruments, and he was
one of the incorporators, on 15 March, 1845, of the Magnetic telegraph company.
the first telegraph company in the United States. He was associated in 1848 in
the incorporation of the American telegraph company, and had charge of its
lines from Boston to New York. Mr. Rogers was its first superintendent, and was
likewise superintendent of the Western union, Bankers and brokers', and
Southern and Atlantic lines. During the civil war he was acting master in the
volunteer navy, and he afterward returned to Baltimore, where he spent the
remaining years of his life. Mr. Rogers published &quot;Telegraph Dictionary
and Seaman's Signal-Book&quot; (Baltimore, 1845); &quot;American Semaphoric
SignalBook &quot; (1847) ; &quot; American Code of Marine Signals &quot;
(1854); and, with Walter P. Larkins. edited &quot;Rogers's Commercial Code of
Signals for all Nations&quot; (1859). <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=RU><o:p> <font face="Arial"> "_April 27.[1847] This you will recognize by the date is my birthday; 36 years<br>
old. Only think, I shall never be 26 again. Don't you wish you were as<br>
young as I am? Well, if _feelings_ determined age I should be in reality<br>
what I have above stated, but that leaf in the family Bible, those boys<br>
and that daughter, those nieces and nephews of younger brothers, and<br>
especially that _grandson_, they all concur in putting twenty years more<br>
to those 36. I cannot get them off; there they are 56!...<br>
<br>
"There is an underhand intrigue against my telegraph interests in<br>
Virginia, fostered by a friend turned enemy in the hope to better his own<br>
interests, a man whom I have ever treated as a friend while I had the<br>
governmental patronage to bestow, and gave him office in Baltimore.<br>
Having no more of patronage to give I have no more friendship from him.<br>
Mr. R. has proved himself false, notwithstanding his naming his son after<br>
me as a proof of friendship."<br>
<br>
The Mr. R. referred to was Henry J. Rogers, and, writing of him to Vail<br>
on April 26, Morse says: "I am truly grieved at Rogers's conduct. He must<br>
be conscious of doing great injustice; for a man that has wronged another<br>
is sure to invent some cause for his act if there has been none given. In<br>
this case he endeavors to excuse his selfish and injurious acts by the<br>
false assertion that 'I had cast him overboard.' Why, what does he mean?<br>
Was I not overboard myself? Does he or anyone else suppose I have nothing<br>
else to do than to find them places, and not only intercede for them,<br>
which in Rogers's case and Zantziger's I have constantly and<br>
perseveringly done to the present hour, but I am bound to force the<br>
companies, over which I have no control, to take them at any rate, on the<br>
penalty of being traduced and injured by them if they do not get the<br>
office they seek? As to Rogers, you know my feelings towards him and his.<br>
I had received him as a _friend_, not as a mere employee, and let no<br>
opportunity pass without urging forward his interests. I recollected his<br>
naming his son for me, and had determined, if the wealth actually came<br>
which has been predicted to me, that that child should be remembered."<br>
<br>
Always desirous of being just and merciful, Morse writes to Vail on May<br>
1: "Rogers is here. I have had a good deal of conversation with him, and<br>
the result is that I think that some circumstances which seemed to<br>
inculpate him are explicable on other grounds than intention to injure<br>
us."<br>
<br>
But he was finally forced to give him up, for on August 7 he writes: "You<br>
cannot tell how pained I am at being compelled to change my opinion of R.<br>
Your feelings correspond entirely with my own. I was hoping to do<br>
something gratifying to him and his family, and soon should have done it<br>
if he would permit it; but no! The mask of friendship covered a deep<br>
selfishness that scrupled not to sacrifice a real friendship to a<br>
shortsighted and overreaching ambition. Let him go. I wished to befriend<br>
him and his, and would have done so from the heart, but as he cannot<br>
trust me I have enough who can and do."<br>
<br>
The case of Rogers was typical, and I have, therefore, given it in some<br>
detail. It was always a source of grief to Morse when men, whom in his<br>
large-hearted way he had admitted to his intimacy, turned against him;<br>
and he was called upon to suffer many such blows. He has been accused of<br>
having quarrelled with all his associates. This, of course, is not true,<br>
for we have only to name Vail, and Gale, and Kendall, and Reid, and a<br>
host of others to prove the contrary. But, like all men who have achieved<br>
great things, he made bitter enemies, some of whom at first professed<br>
sincere friendship for him and were implicitly trusted by him. However, a<br>
dispassionate study of all the circumstances leading up to the rupture of<br>
these friendly ties will prove that, in practically every case he was<br>
sinned against, not sinning.<br>

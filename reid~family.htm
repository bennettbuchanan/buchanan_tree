<p><b>Reid Family </b></p>
<p>The Reid family appears throughout Buchanan correspondence and quite a few images of members of the family are in the collection.</p>
<p>According to a penciled note on the verso of a photograph of the Reid family and written by James Buchanan (tile), &quot;Mrs. Reid was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Rowan of Bardstown, Ky.&quot; He identified the three young men standing behind Mrs. Reid as &quot;My Cousins.&quot;</p>
<p>James Buchanan (tile) seems to have maintained a life-long correspondence with his cousin John Rowan Reid.</p>
<p>From San Diego Union, 3/18/1934</p>
<p>&quot;in 1848 John Rowan, Jr., U.S. minister to Italy...Rowan was the grandfather of San Diegan John Rowan Reid. Judge John Rowan, great grandfather of Reid figured in early Kentucky history.&quot;</p>
<p>John Rowan Reid's father was Col. Samuel Chester Reid. SCR had five children mentioned in his obituary appearing in the Washington Post on February 24, 1941. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>John Rowan Reid (of Philadelphia) </li>

  <li>Mrs. F. H. Parkhurst (of Bangor, ME)</li>
  <li>Mr. S. Chester Reid (of New York)</li>
  <li>Mr. W. S. Reid ( no location)</li>
</ul>
<p>The obituary continues: &quot;in 1866 Col. Reid, then a resident of Kentucky, married Miss Josie Rowan, daughter of the United States Minister to Naples and graddaughter of the celebrated statesman and Senator from Kentucky, John Rowan.&quot;</p>
<p>A note scribbled at the bottom of the obituary by James M. Buchanan (tile) states: &quot;This was the Husband of my Cousin, Mrs. J. Reid, formerly Miss Rowan.&quot;</p>
<p>From a letter from Betty Buchanan to Lillian Buchanan: &quot;Capt. William H. Rowand and James M. B., Jr. [cw] were first cousins--Capt. Rowan--son of Judge Rowan (their mothers were sisters). Rowan Buchanan was named after Judge Rowan.&quot; </p>

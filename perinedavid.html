<p> Archives of Maryland (Biographical Series) David M. Perine (1796-1882) MSA SC 3520-15005 Biography: David Maulden Perine was born in Baltimore City in August 1796 to Maulden and Hephzibah Perine. Maulden Perine died in 1797, and two years later, in 1799, Hephzibah married William Buchanan.1 Hephzibah would later have five children with Buchanan: William J., James Madison, George, Susan, and Charles Adams Buchanan.2 Perine married Mary Glenn, daughter of the Honorable Elias Glenn, judge of the United States District Court, and sister of the Honorable John Glenn, who replaced his father on that bench.3 Together they had eight children: Ann Carson, Susan Buchanan, Mary Glenn, William Buchanan, Rebecca Young, David Maulden, Elias Glenn, and Thomas Harwood Perine.4 Perine died at his home in Baltimore, 17 Cathedral Street, on December 24, 1882, at the age of 87.5 Perine began working in the office of his stepfather, the Register of Wills for Baltimore County, at the age of 14. Buchanan held the position for register for 45 years. For several years prior to Buchanan’s death, Perine performed the duties for him in his stead.6 Perine became a member of a Volunteer Artillery Company on April 1, 1814. He was also initiated into the Corinthian Lodge No. 54 on October 23, 1817.7 After Buchanan’s death, Perine was appointed to the office of Register on January 6, 1825, which he would have held until his death or retirement; however, in 1850, the office was made a publicly elected position and despite the fact that he could have run in the election, he decided to retire in November 1851.8 Upon his retirement, Perine resided at his “counrty seat”, called “Homeland”, which was a few miles north of Baltimore City on Charles Street. He remained active in his private life, and at the Maryland Peace Convention in September 1861, was mentioned as a possible candidate for Governor. Perine, though, would decline the use of his name for the nomination.9 </p>

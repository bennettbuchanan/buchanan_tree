<p>&quot;MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY&quot;</p>
<p>ABERDEEN NAMED BY</p>
<p>EDMUND LAW ROGERS?</p>
<p>&quot;Aberdeen: The Mystery in its History&quot; was examined when Charlotte Garretson Cronin, Aberdeen Museum Curator (whose ancestors in the area date from 1661), gave evidence that Rogers named Aberdeen in his 1852 Village development plat.</p>
<p>Edmund Law Rogers, a Baltimore developer, purchased some 600 acres of Hall&rsquo;s Park from the Hall family after they had failed in their own dream of a development of the area that is now the City of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>Rogers, member of the family who had close relations with Scotland and with Aberdeen, Scotland, selected the name of The Village of Aberdeen for his development of the real estate. He saw an opportunity to make money from the railroad due to their need for water for the steam engines that made 3 stops in the route from Baltimore to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To this day, Aberdeen has always been a refueling stop, not only for water, but gasoline, lodging and food. The Maryland House at Aberdeen on Interstate 95 continues to be a leading stop from New York to Miami.</p>
<p>When George Harold Baker, Sr. found a plat of the Village of Aberdeen in the attic of his home, (the James B. Baker home at 452 West Bel Air Avenue), he suspected that the tale of a Mr. Winston naming Aberdeen was not correct.</p>
<p>Baker had in his hands a plat dated 1852, drawn by Edmund Law Rogers, that named the complete development of Aberdeen that used Rogers family names for the established streets on the plat and as laid out today.</p>
<p>Who were Mr. Winston and Edmund Law Rogers? Who named Aberdeen?</p>
<p>1). Baker, through Clinton Garretson, contacted the Pennsylvania Railroad to research the history of Mr. Winston, who was supposed to be the first railroad station master who named the station beside the first tracks of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad which ran through the area.</p>
<p>2). The railroad reported no existence of a Mr. Winston. Further, they said, the station stop in their records was known as Halls Cross Roads.</p>
<p>3). Researchers of the Aberdeen Room Museum drew a blank as to the tale of Mr. Winston&rsquo;s naming Aberdeen as well as to any such person.</p>
<p>4). Baker then turned to research the Rogers family. He found a connection in his college fraternity (Kappa Sigma) that there was a Rogers who was a founder of the fraternity, and there was a prominent Rogers family in Baltimore, Maryland. The fraternity supplied him with data on Edmund, Jr. and his father Edmund, Sr.</p>
<p>5). The founder was Edmund Law Rogers, Jr., the father of Edmund, was the developer of the Village of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>6). Mr. Baker had a dream of writing a history of Aberdeen. His death came too soon, however, his papers are in the archives of the Aberdeen Room Archives and Museum, donated by his son, George Harold Baker, Jr.</p>
<p>7). Since the tale of Mr. Winston didn&rsquo;t solve the mystery in the history, the Aberdeen Room Archives took up the &quot;mystery solving&quot; endeavor.</p>
<p>8). Research of the Post Office Department showed that Halls Cross Roads was the name until 1862 when the name of the post office was Aberdeen. The railroad research showed that the letter to Mr. Baker stated that the railroad wasn&rsquo;t known as Aberdeen until the 1850's. &quot;The PW &amp; B Railroad Guide&quot; shows a sketch of a station at Aberdeen in 1856.</p>
<p>9). Herman&rsquo;s map of 1790 shows only Halls Cross Roads. Herrick&rsquo;s map of 1858 shows Aberdeen and Hall&rsquo;s Cross Roads.</p>
<p>10). The Hall family, in an effort to develop their land drew a plat of this area in 1850 to be known as Hall&rsquo;s Park and recorded same.</p>
<p>11). Harford County Land Records indicate in the 1852-53 years that the Halls sold some 600 acres to Edmund Law Rogers and associates. Rogers drew the 1852 plat, discovered by Mr. Baker, restored by the Aberdeen Room Archives, a copy of which hangs on the wall of the Aberdeen Room Museum at 18 North Howard Street.</p>
<p>Who was Rogers, and why would he use the name &quot;Aberdeen&quot; on his plat? The question, we think, is intermingled by family and Scottish connections.</p>
<p>1). Grandfather Nicholas Rogers had school and Scottish ties. May have known Buchanan also from Scotland.</p>
<p>2). The Rogers family had Canada and United States border dealings and also with the arbitrator who later became the Earl of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>3). The Rogers family inherited the property of Dr. George Buchanan known as Druid Hill Park today.</p>

<p>&quot;MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY&quot; </p>
<p>Buchanan was born and educated in Scotland. Buchanan moved to Baltimore and married Eleanor Rogers. They had no children and the property passed into the hands of the Rogers family.</p>
<p>4). Edmund Law Rogers, Sr. was born at Druid Hill property, educated at Harvard, had a hobby of architectural design, designed and helped develop Pimlico Race Track where his favorite horse, Preakness, is known today by the race of that name in May of every year. The longest street in Baltimore is known as Rogers Avenue running past the track.</p>
<p>5). Rogers, was in our area of Harford County seeking a water stop for the railroad. He anticipated the potential of the area for development. He took advantage of the misfortunes of the Hall family to purchase the Halls Park which he then changed the name of his development to &quot;Aberdeen.&quot;</p>
<p>6). The dates, the records, all the sources at our disposal at this time, would indicate that Rogers named Aberdeen.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, January 23, 2003, at City of Aberdeen Council Chambers, Charlotte Garretson Cronin as she followed her Heritage lecture, and visuals, she asked the question of the assembled overflowed audience to vote as a jury as to &quot;Who named Aberdeen?&quot;</p>
<p>Having heard the evidence, the jury voted &quot;Edmund Law Rogers.&quot;</p>

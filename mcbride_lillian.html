<p>[Elizabeth Buchanan 
  Lipp] &quot;My mother...Lillian McBride was very beautiful as I had heard people 
  tell me all my life that knew her--she was a librarian in Phila. -- getting 
  the job at 16 after passing the exam with the highest mark--making one mistake--she 
  left the &quot;s&quot; off of Les Miserables--but she had read all of her life 
  everything that was ever written and could quote Shakespeare's plays &quot;backwards 
  and forwards&quot; as they used to say. She quoted Robert Louis Stevenson to 
  us and any fairy tales we wanted. She did not need the books. She had a very 
  vivacious personality and people would say to me--&quot;there was no-one like 
  your mother.&quot; she worked until she was 24--supporting her mother and her 
  sister Gladys. She won a complete scholarship to the Academy of Fine Arts and 
  her mother wouldn't let her take it--as she said--&quot;that is only for rich 
  men's daughters.&quot; She was accepted for a nursing course but got the same 
answer from her mother.&quot; [<a href="notes.html">1</a>]  </p>
<p>Recipient &quot;through the personal representative of Lillian McBride Buchanan&quot; of part of estate of Francis M. McBride (Orphans Court of Philadelphia County, April Term, 1885) through Elizabeth McBride. Will confirmed June 27, 1921. </p>

  M. Buchanan (d 1956) to his son James M. Buchanan (d 1976) reads:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Mrs. Ellen Buchanan <br>
  <br>
  The body of Mrs. Ellen Buchanan, the widow of the Hon. <a href="buchjames_amb.html">James 
  M. Buchanan</a> of Baltimore, who died in Washington, was brought to Baltimore 
  and interred beside that of her husband in the family lot in Greenmount yesterday. 
  Prior to the removal of the body to Baltimore, which was made under the direction 
  of Mr. <a href="/perinedavid.html">E. Glenn Perine</a> of this city, a nephew 
  of the deceased, requiem mass was celebrated at St. Patrick's Church, Washington, 
  by the Rev. Father Stafford. Mrs. Buchanan's husband was a cousin and namesake 
  of President James M. Buchanan. He was a well-known lawyer in this city before 
  the Civil War, and was Minister to Denmark during Buchanan's Administration. 
  As Postmaster of Baltimore, he was the first to append his signature to the 
  original issue of United States postage stamps, and samples of this issue bearing 
  his signature are now valued at $4000 each. While in Copenhagen with her husband, 
  Mrs. Buchanan formed the acquaintance of the present Queen of England, who is 
  a daughter of Frederick the XII, of Denmark, the then reigning sovereign. On 
  the accession of the Queen to the throne of England recently, Mrs. Buchanan 
  wrote her a letter of congratulation, which is regarded as a remarkable production 
  to emanate from a woman 90 years of age. Mrs. Buchanan was a cousin of Francis 
  Scott Key, the author of the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; and it was her 
  son, W. Jefferson Buchanan, who was the official representative of the Confederacy 
  at the Vatican.&quot;<br>

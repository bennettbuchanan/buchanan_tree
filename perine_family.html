<b>Perine Family</b><br>
<br>
<h3><span class="bodytext">In the decades following the success of Roland Park, 
  Edward H. Bouton<br>
  and the Roland Park Company developed Homeland. It too was carefully planned, 
  and although the homes are a bit more &quot;modest&quot; than those in Roland 
  Park and Guilford, it has it's own distinctive flavor and is a cozy, cheerful 
  community. It's architecture is perhaps the most &quot;American&quot;.</span></h3>

  These few paragraphs describe how Homeland got it's name.</span></h3>
<p align="left"><span class="bodytext"><br>
  </span><span class="bodytext">For many years Homeland 
  belonged to the Perine family &amp; was one of the country estates for which 
  the vicinity of Baltimore was noted, such as: Doughregan Manor, Hampden, Guilford, 
  Poplar Hill, Homewood, Woodlawn and others. Homeland's recorded history dates 
  from the latter part of the 17th century. A patent was issued to Job Evans in 
  1694 for &quot;all that tract in Baltimore County in the woods between the part 
  of the ridge called Little Brittaine containing 100 acres, more or less&quot; 
  The next year Evans bought 225 acres adjoining a tract known as &quot;The Friend's 
  Discovery&quot; and called this new portion &quot;Job's Addition&quot;. Part 
  of that property was sold in 1778 to Darby Lux by James Dewhurst, other successive 
  owners having been Luke Merryman, Gerard Hopkins, and Rebecca Ridgely, who sold 
  150 acres of it in 1797 to William Buchanan, son of Dr. George Buchanan, of 
  Druid Hill, now Druid Hill Park.<br>
  <br>
  In 1799 Buchanan married Hepzibah Brown Perine, daughter of David Brown of New 
  Jersey, and widow of Maulden Perine, who had settled in Baltimore Town in 1793. 
  Her son by her first marriage, David Maulden Perine, came with her to live at 
  &quot;Job's Addition&quot;. He was then 3 years old.<br>
  <br>
  The family originally spelled its name &quot;Perrin&quot;. Daniel Perrin settled 
  on Staten Island in 1665. A descendant, already spelling it &quot;Perine&quot;, 
  was William Perine. His son was Maulden Perine who died young and whose widow 
  was Hepzibah. Her second husband, William Buchanan, was the owner of &quot;Job's 
  Addition&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Hepzibah Perine Buchanan died at &quot;Job's Addition&quot; in 1832. After the 
  death of Buchanan, David Maulden Perine bought the original property that had 
  been owned by his step-father and added to it, so that by 1875 it finally reached 
  391 acres, its present size. He renamed the estate Homeland. Although he maintained 
  a townhouse in downtown Baltimore, he lived much of the time at Homeland until 
  his death in 1882.</span><br>

<p><b>Henry Sinclair. Rogers</b></p>
<p>b 1847 </p>
<p><strong>1880 NY Census</strong> shows HSR (age 32) married to Sidney A. Rogers (age 29 (ca. 1851), she was born in PA with both parents born in PA). Both resided in NYC. No children. Listed &quot;Stockbroker&quot; as his occupation.&quot; Her occupation was listed as &quot;wife&quot; &quot;keeping house.&quot; Residence is 950 9th Avenue, NYC. </p>
<p>Involved in Colorado mining company stock </p>
<p>Henry S. Rogers is the brother of Susan Therese Rogers. In his will dated August 23, 1890, he states:</p>
<p>&quot;...names of those entitled to share in the above F[l]orestine T. Buchanan, Ellen M. Buchanan, Elizabeth Buchanan, James Buchanan, children of my deceased sister Susan T. Buchanan late of Baltimore, Md. Henry J. Rogers son of my deceased brother Franklin M. Rogers...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As to my nephew James Buchanan or (James M. Jr) I understand he lives with his father in Washington, D.C. but as his father is not the proper person to be his guardian I hope it will be arranged through legal means to have someone else appointed to take charge of his share until he be of age.&quot;</p>

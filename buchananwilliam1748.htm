</div>
  <p class="style2">In the Maryland Journal <br>
  of the 28th of May, 1774, a notice appeared, of which the following is a <br>
  copy: "On Tuesday last, a few hours after the arrival of an express from <br>
  Philadelphia relative to the situation of affairs at Boston, a number of <br>
  merchants and respectable mechanics of this town met at the Court-house, <br>
  and appointed a committee to correspond with<br>
  <br>
  Page 126<br>
  <br>
  the neighboring colonies, as the exigency of affairs may make it <br>
  occasionally necessary." This committee was Robert Alexander, Robert <br>
  Christie, Sr., Isaac Van Bibber, Thomas Harrison, John Boyd, Samuel <br>
  Purviance, Jr., <strong>Andrew Buchanan</strong>, <strong>Wm. Buchanan</strong>, John Moale, Wm. Smith, Win. <br>
  Lux, and John Smith.</p>
  <p class="style2">===========</p>
  <p class="style2">November 13th the Continental Congress having recommended that adventures <br>
  be made for procuring arms and ammunition, and it being necessary that a <br>
  particular committee be appointed to superintend the same, Messrs. Samuel <br>
  Purviance, John Smith, <strong>William Buchanan,</strong> Benjamin Griffith, Isaac Griest, <br>
  Thomas Gist, Sen., and Darby Lux were appointed a committee for that <br>
  purpose, under oath to keep their proceedings secret. Lady Washington and <br>
  the lady of Gen. Gates arrived in town on the way to their respective <br>
  husband's camps; they were escorted a few miles out of town by a part of <br>
  the Independent and Light Infantry companies, with many other gentlemen.</p>
  <p class="style2">=========</p>
  <p class="style2">The following letter was written to Captain James Cox, who commanded a <br>
  company in Baltimore Town, by William Buchanan, who commanded the <br>
  battalion in said town:<br>
  <br>
  "Baltimore, 13th December, 1776.<br>
  <br>
  "Sir:--By letter from General Buchanan of this date, I am directed to <br>
  order the several Companies of my Battalion, to hold themselves in <br>
  readiness to march for Philadelphia on the shortest notice, from the <br>
  Council of Safety, to him for that purpose, and which I know is hourly <br>
  expected. Every excuse of inconvenience, interest, &amp;c., must now cease. <br>
  You will therefore, without a moment's loss of time, acquaint your company <br>
  thereof, that I may have the pleasure of meeting you as complete as <br>
  possible at the place of rendezvous, of which you will have previous <br>
  notice should there be occasion. Should any effective men in your company <br>
  be so lost to virtue and his bleeding country as to refuse or skulk, under <br>
  any pretence whatever, I desire you will furnish me with the names thereof.<br>
  <br>
  I am, sir, your obedient servant,   Wm. Buchanan."</p>
  <p class="style2">===============</p>
  <p class="style2">The following order was written by Wm. Buchanan, Lieut. of the County, to <br>
  Capt. James Cox:<br>
  <br>
  "Baltimore, June 30th, 1777.<br>
  <br>
  "Sir:--In consequence of a very pressing requisition from the<br>
  <br>
  Page 164<br>
  <br>
  Congress, for a reinforcement to General Washington from the Militia of <br>
  Maryland, and orders from the Council of Safety to Brigadier-General <br>
  Buchanan, I have it in orders from him, to hold my battalion in readiness <br>
  to march with all possible expedition for that purpose. I therefore desire <br>
  a meeting of the battalion, on the usual ground on Tuesday, the fourth of <br>
  February, precisely at ten o'clock, when (all excuses apart) you will not <br>
  tail to attend with every effective enroller in your company. The <br>
  emergency is such that arguments are useless, to such as have the least <br>
  sense of duty they owe the country, themselves and family; and with such <br>
  as neither reason nor duty will prevail, other measures must be taken; but <br>
  I flatter myself there are very few such in the battalion I have the honor <br>
  to command.<br>
  <br>
  "I am, Sir, your humble servant,   Wm. Buchanan."</p>

  <p class="style2">On the organization of the Court of Appeals, Thomas Jones, Esq., was <br>

  Doctor George Buchanan, deceased, succeeds to the office of Register of <br>
  Wills the next year, in place of Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>Dear. Bill and Nancy. This is a De Gerry-type Photo of your dear--Great Grandmother Elizabeth Rogers, who, was my G-mother and wife of my G-father Henry-J. Rogers. Who helped to perfect the first Telegraph. The magnetic between Balto and Washington D.C. also [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] Superintende of this Co. Jim Jr. can give you more details about this. As he as the data. This is very bad writing but the best I can do under the circumstances. </p>
<p>This picture is a little faded but it can be brought back the way it was a hundred years ago. So, Al said the cost of these pictures at time of taking was high.&quot; $50.00 and $75.00 each. Yes your dear great G-father had dough in those days--a grand old man. Dad B.&quot;</p>

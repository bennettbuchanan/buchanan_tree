10th Day of July, in the 15th Year of the Dominion of the Right Honourable 
Charles, absolute Lord and Proprietary of the Province of Maryland and 
Avalon, Lord Baron of Baltimore, &amp;c., and ended the 8th of August, Anne 
Domini 1729, was enacted the following law: 'Benedict Leonard Calvert, 
Esq., Governor. Passed Aug. 8th, 1729:--An Act for erecting a Town on the 
North side of Patapsco, in Baltimore County, and for laying out in Lots, 
Sixty Acres of Land, in and about the place where one John Fleming now 
lives.'" By this Act Major Thomas Tolley, William Hamilton, William 
Buckner, Dr. George Walker, Richard Gist, <strong>Dr. George Buchanan</strong> and Colonel 
William Hammond were appointed commissioners to lay off the town. They 
were all justices of the county, excepting Doctor Walker, and as such, 
generally deputy commissaries; some of them were delegates before or 
after. Mr. Gist, then deputy surveyor of the western shore, was the son of 
Mr. Christopher Gist, or Guest, as in some records, who had settled on the 
south side of the Patapsco as early as 1682, and died before the river 
became the bounds of the county; <strong>Dr. Buchanan, who came from Scotland, 
purchased lands and practised medicine in the county from the year 1723; </strong>
Colonel Hammond was, from all accounts, the son of Mr. John Hammond, who 
settled on the north side of the Patapsco, upon lands for which he paid 
forty shillings sterling per acre, as early as 1695; Mr. Hamilton 
purchased lands in the county, as appears by the records, in 1710; Doctor 
Walker, with a brother James, had practised medicine in Anne Arundel 
county some years, but came to reside in Baltimore county about the year 
1715, and was the proprietor of that well-known seat and tract of land on 
the west side of the town called Chatsworth, which is occupied at present 
by Daniel B. Banks, on Franklin street; Mr. Buckner had not apparently 
been long settled in the country, but in 1726 became purchaser of several 
tracts of land in Patapsco Neck. John Flemming, who has thus travelled 
down to posterity by Act of Assembly, and to whose memory a great city may 
now be almost deemed a monument, was a tenant of Mr. Carroll's; and the 
antiquarian who revels in the occupation of deciphering the almost 
illegible remnants of the past, may deposit himself on the east side of 
South Charles Street at the intersection of Lombard, and repeating, as he 
may do with perfect security, "here was once the homestead of John 
Flemming," enjoy at his ease the associations that the occasion may give 
rise to. The Commissioners of Baltimore Town were appointed for life, and 
were authorised to fill their own vacancies; also empowered "to purchase 
(by agreement, or valuation of a jury) sixty acres of land, on the tract 
whereon John Flemming now lives, commonly known by the name of 'Cole's 
Harbor;' and to lay out the same in the most convenient manner into sixty 
equal lots, to be erected into a town. The land being laid out, surveyed, 
marked, staked out and divided into convenient streets, lanes, &amp;c., and 
the lots marked,

Page 21

numbered, &amp;c., the owner of the land to have the first choice for one lot, 
after which the remaining lots to be taken up by others, none to take up 
more than one lot during the first four months, nor any but the 
inhabitants of the county within six months after laying out; after which 
vacant lots may be taken up by any other persons. The takers-up of lots to 
pay the owner of the land the valuation of the sixty acres, proportionably 
to their lots, which shall give such purchasers, their heirs and assigns, 
an absolute estate, in fee simple, in said lots; they complying with the 
requisites in this Act mentioned. The surveyor to return a plat of the 
town to the County Clerk, to be by him kept among the county records. In 
case the taker-up of any lot or lots neglect to build thereon within 
eighteen months, a house that shall cover 400 square feet, then may any 
other person enter upon such lot or lots so not built upon, paying the 
Commissioners, or person by them thereunto appointed, the sum first set 
and assessed upon such lot, for the use and benefit of the town; provided, 
such second taker-up do build and finish, within eighteen months after 
such his entry made, such house as in this Act is before limited and 
appointed be built by the first taker-up; which house so built, shall give 
as good estate to such second taker-up as is by this Act settled upon the 
first taker-up and builder. If any lots remain untaken after seven years 
from the date of this Act, then shall the owner of the land (after such 
time has expired) be possessed and interested in such lots, as in his 
first and former estate. The town to be called Baltimore Town; the 
Commissioners to employ a sufficient clerk to make true and impartial 
entries of their proceedings, upon oath, which entries shall be made up 
into a well bound book, and lodged with the clerk of Baltimore county 
court, for the inspection of any person, saving to the Crown, the Lord 
Proprietor, all bodies politic and corporate, and all others not mentioned 
in this Act their several rights." On the first of December, Messrs. 
Richard Gist, William Hamilton, Doctors Buchanan and Walker, agreed with 
Mr. Charles Carroll, acting for himself and brother Daniel, about the 
price and purchase of the sixty acres of land, to be erected into a town 
called Baltimore Town, in honor of the Lord Proprietary, who in his turn 
had borrowed his from a town of the same name, which stands on a 
promontory in the sea, in the County of Cork, Ireland, at the rate of 
forty shillings per acre in current money of Maryland, or tobacco, to be 
paid into the hands of the Sheriff of the County, at the rate of one penny 
per pound, this to be paid by each "taker-up" of lots.

1730. On the 12th of January, the commissioners, assisted by Philip Jones, 
the county surveyor, laid off the town, commencing at a point near the 
northwest corner of what is now called Pratt and Light streets and running 
thence northwesterly, along or near Uhler's alley, towards what was then 
called a "great eastern road" and "a great gully" or drain at or near 
Sharp street, thence....

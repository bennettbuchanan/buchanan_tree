The <i>Maryland Journal</i> reported: "He bravely embarked as a volunteer, and behaved with the steady fortitude of an old voyager. The gazing multitude below wafted him their loud applause, the receipt of which, as he was soaring aloft, he politely acknowledged by a significant wave of his hat."</font></font> </p>

  <p><font color="black">In June of 1784, Marylander Peter Carnes flew the first tethered balloon in America, but it was de Rozier&rsquo;s competitor Jean Pierre Blanchard, who would be the first balloon pilot to fly in America. Blanchard, who built his first balloon a few weeks after Montgolfier, had already traveled all over Europe giving demonstration flights in Germany, Poland, Austria, and the Netherlands. Now, it was America&rsquo;s turn.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">On January 9, 1793, Blanchard was ready for the first aerial voyage of the New World. In front of what is now Philadelphia&rsquo;s Independence Square, before a large crowd, brass band, and the best of all our colonial regalia, America was ready to celebrate Blanchard&rsquo;s 45th ascension.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">Suddenly, a carriage brought President George Washington inside the walls of the Walnut Street Prison, where, in its yard, the French Ambassador with other high level dignitaries gathered to witness the event. As Blanchard climbed into the wicker basket, President Washington handed him a "passport" and wished him bon voyage.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">Blanchard threw out some ballast, let the tethers go, and gently lifted in a slow ascent just to savor the crowd impressions as he reached for the sky. Once outside the walls of the prison, Blanchard wrote in his journal, there were people everywhere - in the streets, squares, and the fields, roofs of houses and steeples, and all along his flight. The balloon rose 1,200 feet, caught a mild wind from the northwest, and headed toward the Delaware River rising to 5,800 feet.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">In the company of a black dog given him at departure by a well-wisher, Blanchard traveled 15 miles in 46 minutes before beginning descent. He let out some of the envelope&rsquo;s hydrogen and masterfully guided the balloon to a safe landing in a field near Woodbury, NJ.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">After a colorful and eventful return journey, Blanchard was back in Philadelphia that evening to a cheering crowd and received, among others, formal congratulations from President Washington for his extraordinary flight.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">The story written by Blanchard in his journal is the story of a Frenchman in the English-speaking, American countryside, who had just came down from the sky in something never seen before. He has a "passport" given him by President George Washington and is attempting to return to the Country&rsquo;s capital Philadelphia carrying a balloon envelope packed in a wicker gondola. This account is worth the trip to the library or bookstore. Blanchard made several unsuccessful attempts to raise money for another manned flight and to defray the costs of his air experiments before returning to France in 1797. His second wife, Marie-Madeleine-Sophie Armant, became - like her husband - the best-known woman aeronaut in Europe and the first woman to die in a balloon accident.</font></p>
  <p><font color="black">Just like de Rozier&rsquo;s disaster, Marie-Madeleine&rsquo;s aerial accident gave impetus to the idea that ballooning was dangerous, thus creating a sense and need for safety. After an extremely fast-paced beginning, the evolution of ballooning slowed down considerably when compared with other areas in aviation. Until the early 1960&rsquo;s with the introduction of propane burners, balloons changed little, despite long and colorful stories handed down over generations of balloon pioneers.</font></p>

    MUNGO<sup>2</sup> 
    BUCHANAN<i> 
    (</i><i>R</i><i>OBERT</i><sup>1</sup><i>)</i>

    <br>
    Notes for MUNGO 
    BUCHANAN:<br>
    St. Kentigern Garthwys (aka Mungo and Kentigern Mungo) <br>
    Mungo is Gaelic for "friend" or "darling" <br>
    <br>
    Prince Kentigern, was the fruit of King Owein and Princess Thaney's illicit 
    liaison. The otherwise unknown Garthwys is thought to be the place of his 
    birth. Under his nickname of Mungo, he was brought up by St. Serf in Culross 
    (Fife). Later he travelled to Strathclyde where he was ordained by an Irish 
    missionary Bishop before continuing the work of St. Ninian in converting the 
    locals around Glasgow. Here he founded an Episcopal See where he lived an 
    austere life sleeping on a bed of stone, fasting and praying while standing 
    naked in the Clyde. He was, however, persecuted by King Morken Mwynfawr (the 
    Wealthy), and was obliged to flee. <br>
    <br>
    Settling in Wales, Kentigern first stayed with St. David but was later instructed 
    by St. Asaph. He made seven pilgrimages to Rome, before eventually being called 
    back to Strathclyde. King Morken had been succeeded by his brother, Riderch 
    Hael (the Generous), the great ally of Kentigern's ageing grandfather. Riderch 
    had already been converted to Christianity and made Kentigern the first Bishop 
    of Strathclyde. He built churches and erected crosses far and wide, including 
    Hoddam and Borthwick, and became firm friends with St. Columba. Kentigern 
    died of shock after getting into a hot bath on 13th January 612! He was buried 
    in his foundation, Glasgow Cathedral. Some say he lived to the age of 185! 
    Though just into his 80s is much more likely. <br>

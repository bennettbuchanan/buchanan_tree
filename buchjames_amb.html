  <p>Inscription in 
    Ophelia (1844): &quot;To Mrs. James M. Buchanan from her Brother John Rowan.&quot;</p>
  <p>Reminiscence 
    by James M. Buchanan (d 1956). &quot;Here are a few facts as I remember my 
    father telling me when a boy about my grand father. He lived in the State 
    of Md all his life and was a very prominent Lawyer and Judge in Balto. in 
    the years of the Sixtys. He also was Postmaster of said City and also introduced 
    the famous Buchana postage stamp that stamp collectors love to get hold of. 
    He was United States Minister to Denmark under President Buchanan's Administration, 
    also one of the donators to the Washington Monument in Balto. and has his 
    name on the bronze plate on said Monument. His picture hangs in the State 
    Department at Wash- among onther foreign Ministers. He died around 1880 and 
    is buried in Greenmount Cemetary, Balto Md. I have heard tell that some of 
    his ancestors were buried in Druid Hill park, Balto Md. He was the father 
    of 5 Sons and 1 Daughter.-- John, James, Buck, Harney, Francis-Key and Rebecca. 
    They are all deceased. There remains only my 4 Sisters and self and my 4 Children. 
    P.S. My Grand father was related to the well known Perrine family of Balto. 
    also.&quot; {Buchanan to Arthur Howell, &lt; Sept. 1, 1929, responding to 
    Howell to Buchanan on 9.1.1929 requesting family history for genealogy of 
    Howell's family and particularly that of John and Ann Howell &quot;because 
    it is believed by some of the descendants that he was heir to title and large 
    estate, also considerable money, which is held in chancery by British Government 
    for want of legal proof of heirs.&quot;}</p>
